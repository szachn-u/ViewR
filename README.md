# ViewR

ViewR is a Web browser for NGS data exploration, that allows the vizualisation of any read coverage across the genome (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, etc), along with the corresponding gene annotation.

# How It Works

ViewR is designed to take coverage data files in [bigWig format](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigWig.html and annotation as [gtf](https://www.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html)
